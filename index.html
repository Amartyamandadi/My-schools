    <p>The first independent campus of St. Andrews School came up in the peaceful suburbs of Bowenpally in 1987. Moving from a rented building to a sprawling campus spread across ten acres, St. Andrews School, Bowepally caught the imagination of the people with its imposing buildings and wide-open spaces.</p>
    <p>The sprawling campus, offering classes from Playschool to Class XII, is divided into Junior, Middle, Secondary and Senior Secondary Blocks with well-stocked libraries and dedicated laboratories in each, in addition to Administrative and Sports Blocks. Latest on campus is Akira - a learning centre for children with Dyslexia.</p>
    <p>
        
The school gives equal importance to academics and co-curricular activities, by housing extensive academic facilities and cutting-edge skill-development infrastructure. Each year, the school churns out young talents in sports who make the school and the country proud. St. Andrews School is committed to providing the students what they deserve to explore their fullest potential and become highly skilled citizens.
